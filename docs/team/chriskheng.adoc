== PROJECT: Scheduler

== Overview

In many co-curricular activities (CCAs), interviews are usually conducted to recruit new members during the beginning of
the semester. However, the scheduling of interviews can be a very tedious process, especially when there are a lot of applicants.
In light of this, we created Scheduler, a desktop application which aims to automate and streamline the process of
scheduling interviews to reduce the workload of the administrators.

The main feature of Scheduler is to match interviewees with available interview time slots to generate an optimal interview schedule.
Other features introduced to streamline the process of scheduling interviews include emailing the allocated slot to the respective
interviewee. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and
has around 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the **ability to schedule interviews automatically** using a graph algorithm
** What it does: allows the user to schedule interviews automatically for the interviewees using the imported interviewers
availability and interviewees details.
** Justification: This feature is the central feature behind the idea of the entire Scheduler application which is to schedule interviews
automatically so that the user does not have to manually schedule interviews and thus reduce their workload significantly.
** Highlights: The scheduling feature uses an algorithm known as **Hopcroft Karp algorithm** which tries to maximise the number of interviewees who are allocated
with an interview slot. Please refer to the developer guide for more information regarding the algorithm.
** Credits:
*** John Hopcroft, Richard Karp, Alexander Karzanov, the creators of Hopcroft-Karp algorithm which enables our application to maximise
the number of interviewees which are allocated an interview slot.
*** Authors of https://www-m9.ma.tum.de/graph-algorithms/matchings-hopcroft-karp/index_en.html, for the clear explanation of
the logic behind Hopcroft Karp algorithm.

* *Minor enhancement*: Updated the link in the help window.

* *Other contributions to features*
** Created a data structure `Schedule` which models a schedule timetable as can be seen in the application. The data structure
is used to link multiple features together, such as adding an interviewer and displaying it on the ui.
** Modified and implemented the logic which links the displayed schedules in the UI to the underlying `Schedule` data structures
such that changes to the schedules data can be updated in the UI by using the **Observer pattern**.
** Created an `AppStatus` class using the *Singleton design principle* to help to manage the status of the application
across different functionalities.
