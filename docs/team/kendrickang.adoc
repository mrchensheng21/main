== PROJECT: Scheduler

== Overview

People who hold leadership positions, especially those in student-led clubs, have to usually schedule interviews with those interested in applying to
leadership positions during recruitment period. Usually, there are clashing preferred time slots between interviewees, which the interviewer has to slowly and manually resolve.
We therefore came up with Scheduler, a desktop application used to automate and streamline the process of interview scheduling.
Scheduler matches interviewees with interview time slots to generate an optimal interview timetable.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to manually `add`, `edit` and `delete` entities (interviewees and interviewers)* in Scheduler.

** What it does: This allows the user to manually alter the data currently in Scheduler .

** Justification: This feature is necessary to the product as interview schedules change frequently - interviewees may suddenly
be unable to attend an interview and withdraw from the interview. Interviewers may also be forced to
withdraw due to urgent business. There may also be more applicants, and hence interviewees. In these cases, the ability to
manually change data in Scheduler is essential.

** Highlights:

*** This enhancement deeply affects the foundational structure of Scheduler in `Logic` and `Model`.
*** It requires an in-depth understanding of the existing code base, concepts like regex expression design to ensure input validity and the Jackson library to convert objects to JSON format.
*** The implementation was also challenging as it required changes to existing commands and deletion of irrelevant fields that were highly coupled to other components. The large number of possible
input arguments for these commands (e.g the `add` command has 8 possible input prefixes) also each required extensive testing to ensure users could not input invalid values.
** Credits: Joshua Bloch, author of Effective Java, for his ideas on Builder patterns as a way to generate objects with optional parameters.
