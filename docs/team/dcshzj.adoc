== PROJECT: Scheduler

== Overview

In many student clubs or even in the corporate world, there are many instances in which the organisation needs to match interviewers with interviewees, especially during times of mass recruitment. Scheduler is a desktop application that was conceived to automate this laborious process of scheduling interviews and to minimise human errors in the scheduing process.

The main feature of Scheduler is to match interviewees with the available time slots of interviewers, so as to generate an overall interview timetable for all interviewees and interviewers. The user is able to interact with the application using a command-line interface (CLI), and it also comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to automatically generate email*
** What it does: It allows the user to automatically generate the email to be used for sending to an interviewee after the interview scheduling process has been completed. The email will be populated with information such as the allocated time slot and another content that can be configured as part of the user preferences.
** Justification: This feature drastically improves the efficiency of the user as it is extremely tedious to extract out each interviewee's email and allocated time slot and manually crafting a unique message to each interviewee after the interview allocation is completed.
** Highlights: A significant portion of the Storage to disk had to be redesigned in order to accommodate the deviation of the program's original architecture of being an Address Book into something that is able to hold different categories of people.
** Credits: _None_

* *Minor enhancement*: Restructured the program's Model and Storage to accommodate the change in the program's architecture and integrated with changes from other aspects of the program.
