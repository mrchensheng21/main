== Introduction
Due to vastly different timetables, scheduling interviews that don't clash for applicants to positions in an NUS
Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) during peak recruitment period can be difficult. Scheduler is an app that can automate this scheduling of interviews for
secretaries in NUS CCAs. Given templates adapted from exported NUSync CCA sign-up lists, Scheduler generates an optimal
matching of interviewees to time slots. Scheduler also supports manual input. It is optimised for people who **prefer
typing in a Command Line Interface (CLI)** to quickly access the functionality of an app. +

Click on <<Quick Start, Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start
This guide shows you how to import your interviewees details and interviewers availability into Scheduler to begin managing your interview schedule.
It also shows you basic tips on how to add or delete and edit interviewers/interviewees based on your changing needs.

// tag::quickstart_import[]

=== Import your csv file into the application
To begin, let's download sample interviewers availability and interviewees details in comma-separated value (.csv) format and import the data into Scheduler.

Sample/Template of Interviewer's Availability and Interviewee Details

* Interviewers' availability: http://bit.ly/interviewerTemplate
* Interviewees' details: http://bit.ly/intervieweeDetails

Type `import interviewer fp/FILE_PATH` to import interviewers availability. To import interviewees details, type
`import interviewee fp/FILE_PATH` . `FILE_PATH` is the full/absolute file path to where the interviewers availability or
interviewees details .csv file is located.

When you have imported interviewers' availability, you will see that the interviewer's availability are displayed as tables in
the Schedules tab. In the tables, there will be cells with 1 and 0s. 1 means that the interviewer of that column is available for interview at that particular
time slot (the time slot is at the leftmost column on the same row where the 1 is located), otherwise is 0. The imported interviewers details will also be displayed
in the Interviewers tab.

// end::quickstart_import[]

// tag::quickstart_add[]

=== Manually add interviewees and interviewers
Forgot to include some data before importing? No problem!

To add an interviewee, use the `add` command. The interviewee will then be displayed in the Interviewees tab.

Here we add an interviewee with the following characteristics:

. *Name* - John Doe
. *Phone number* - 91234567
. *Faculty* - School of Computing
. *Year of study* - 2019
. *Department of interest* - Marketing
. *Personal Email* - john_doe@gmail.com
. *Work email* (should be an NUS email) - john_doe@u.nus.edu
. *Preferred time slots* - 17/10/2019, 1pm to 2pm

 add interviewee n/John Doe p/91234567 f/School of Computing y/1 ep/john_doe@gmail.com ew/john_doe@u.nus.edu d/Marketing s/17/10/2019 13:00-14:00

* Note that all fields specified above are *compulsory* when adding an interviewee manually.
* Please also note that the added interviewee cannot be already present in the application data, ie. no duplicates are allowed.

Similarly, to add an interviewer with the characteristics:

. *Name* - Bohn Coe
. *Phone number* - 9765421
. *Work email* (should be an NUS email) - bohn_coe@u.nus.edu
. *Department* - Marketing
. *Available time slots* - 17/10/2019, 1pm to 2pm

 add interviewer n/Bohn Coe p/97654321 ew/bohn_coe@u.nus.edu d/Marketing s/17/10/2019 13:00-14:00

* Again, the fields specified above are *compulsory when adding an interviewer manually.
* Please also note that the added interviewer cannot be already present in the application data, ie. no duplicates are allowed.

The added interviewer will be displayed in the Interviewers tab.

// end::quickstart_add[]

// tag::quickstart_everythingElse[]

=== Schedule interviews
Type `schedule` in the command line of the application. Scheduler will then schedule the interviews for you and the result
will be displayed in the Schedules tab! If an interviewee is allocated a time slot, the name of the interviewee will be displayed
in one of the tables in the Schedules tab depending on which slot is allocated to him/her.

At the cell which displays the interviewee's name, the time slot allocated to it is on the leftmost column of the same row, and the interviewer that will be interviewing
him/her is the name displayed beside the department in the first row of the same column.

=== Email Interviewee
Want to email the allocated time slot to an interviewee? Simply type `email ct/timeslot n/INTERVIEWEE NAME`, replacing
`INTERVIEWEE NAME` with the name of the interviewee.

=== Export Scheduled Result
Now let's export the scheduled result to an external .csv file! Simply type `export fp/FILE_PATH`, replacing `FILE_PATH` with the full/absolute
path to your target destination of the .csv file. If the .csv file has not exist, Scheduler will create the exported result file
at the target destination you specify in `FILE_PATH`!

That's all for the quick start, hope you enjoy using Scheduler!

// end::quickstart_everythingElse[]

== User Preferences
Scheduler is initialised with default user preferences.

If you wish to make changes to the user preferences, do the following steps: +

* Step 1: Run scheduler.jar at least once. You should notice new files added to the folder containing the application.
* Step 2: Open preferences.json using any word editor, eg. notepad.
* Step 3: Edit the relevant user preference fields.

The details of each user preference field is explained further in the following sections.

=== Working Hours
Each time slot that an interviewer or interviewee indicates, must be within the `startTime` and `endTime` of the pre-defined
working hours for it to be displayed in the schedules.

*Format:* +
`startTime` and `endTime` are defined as strings. It has to follow the string format "HH:mm".

*Default values:* +
`startTime`: "10:00" +
`endTime`: "21:00"

=== Duration of Timeslot
Each time slot that an interviewer or interviewee indicates, must be strictly of this pre-defined duration in the user preference for it to be
 displayed in the schedules. This duration will also determine the number of timeslots daily, each with the indicated duration, from the `startTime` to `endTime` of pre-defined <<Working Hours, Working Hours>>.
*It is represented by `duration` in the user preference file.*

*Format:* +
`duration` is defined as a positive integer representing the number of minutes of each time slot.

*Default values:* +
`duration`: 30

WARNING: When adding interviewees or interviewers manually into Scheduler, the timeslots provided must have a duration (in minutes) that matches `duration`.
In addition, the timeslots indicated must also strictly follow the start and end times of each time slot. Refer to the example below for a clearer idea.

Example:

User preference:

 startTime: "10:00"
 endTime: "21:00"
 duration: 30

Result:

 Timeslots generated:
 10:00-10:30, 10:30-11:00, 11:00-11:30, .... , 20:00-20:30, 20:30-21:00
 //Timeslots are 30min intervals from 10:00 (startTime) to 21:00 (endTime)

As seen in the example above, timeslots are *unique* 30min intervals from the start to the end time of the Working Hours (10:00 to 21:00).
There is no overlap between timeslots. If the indicated duration is not divisible by the Working Hours, the last timeslot generated will be before the end time indicated.

IMPORTANT: The indicated timeslots, in adding or importing interviewers/interviewees, has to be one of these unique timeslots and *cannot take* any other values.
*Failure to do so will result in an inaccurate display of schedules.*

// end::UiDisplay[]

// tag::import[]

=== Importing existing availabilities `import`
2 types of data can be imported - interviewers' availabilities and interviewees' details.
Both of these details needs to be in CSV format and must follow the format given in the templates below.
These templates were adapted versions of NUSync's interview sign up excel sheets.
The templates for the import commands can be found <<Import your csv file into the application, here>>:

TIP: If you wish to import a new set of data of the same type, we strongly recommend that you use the <<Clear all data `clear`, Clear>> command to clear pre-existing data before re-importing newer data.
This is because Scheduler does not allow duplicate persons, for both interviewer and interviewee. Unless you are very certain that the
the second import does not contain any duplicate data, we would suggest that you run the 'clear' command beforehand.

Constraints:

* Data in .csv file must follow the settings defined in the user preference file. View <<User Preferences, User Preferences>> if you wish to change the
default settings.
* Data to be imported should only be in English and should strictly follow the format of the templates given above, e.g. format of headers and timeslots.

==== Importing interviewers’ availability
Imports interviewers’ availability from a comma separated values (CSV) file. After import command is ran, the GUI should display the imported data.

NOTE: The schedule displayed will only show timeslots within the <<Working Hours, Working Hours>> and <<Duration of Timeslot, Duration>> that the user has specified.

Key formatting information for Interviewer's Data:

image::InterviewerData.png[]

* 1. The top left corner of the .csv file consists of 2 attributes which are `Days` and `Interviewers`.
** `Days` is the number of days in the .csv file which is equal to the number of tables in the .csv file. Each table represents
the availability of the interviewers in 1 day.
** `Interviewers` is the number of interviewers in the .csv file. Each interviewer must exist in every table in the .csv file
regardless of whether the interviewer is not available for that entire day.

* 2. The first column of each day's schedule will consist of the timeslots for that day. Each timeslot should also be in the format `HH:mm - HH:mm`.
** Time slots must obey the allowed values that are specified in the <<User Preferences, User Preferences>>.

* 3. The leftmost header in the first row of a table should indicate the **date** of the schedule. The subsequent headers
of the first row should indicate the **interviewers details** in the format of `DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEWER'S_NAME`.
** Except the date, the first row, which are the interviewers details, of every table in the .csv file needs to be the same.

* 4. A "1" in a timeslot represents that the interviewer in that column is *available* and "0" represents that he/she is *unavailable* for that particular timeslot.

* 5. Separation of different tables is made by leaving 2 empty lines after the end of every table.

Format of command: `import interviewer fp/FILE_PATH` +
    - FILE_PATH needs to be of .csv extension +
    - E.g. C:\\Users\Bob\file.csv

Example:

 import interviewer fp/C:\Users\johndoe\Interviewers.csv

Constraints:

* Duplicate entries of the same interviewer (same name) cannot be presented in the CSV file to be imported.
* If none of the interviewers are available for a particular day, e.g. all "0" for all timeslots on that day, the GUI will not display the schedule for that day.

==== Importing interviewees’ availability
Imports interviewees’ availability from a comma separated values (CSV) file.

NOTE: There will be no changes in the schedules tab after the import of interviewee's data. The changes will be made after <<Scheduling `schedule`, Schedule>> command has been ran.

Key formatting information for Interviewee's Data:

image::IntervieweeData.png[]


* The first row specifies the details of the Interviewee to be imported. The order of the headers in the first row must be strictly followed as shown in the above template.
* The constraints of the interviewee details(i.e. format) in Add/Delete/Edit command also applies to the interviewee details in the imported data as well.
* Timeslots: Each timeslot should be in the format `dd/MM/yyy HH:mm - HH:mm`. Use commas to separate the timeslots if there are more than 1.
Timeslots must obey the allowed values that are specified in the <<User Preferences, User Preferences>>.
* There can only be 1 unique value for all other fields. Commas should not be used in these fields.


Format: `import interviewee fp/FILE_PATH` +
    - FILE_PATH needs to be of .csv extension. +
    - E.g C:\\Users\Bob\file.csv

Example:

 import interviewer fp/C:\Users\johndoe\Interviewees.csv

Constraints:

* Duplicate entries of the same interviewee cannot be presented in the CSV file to be imported.
